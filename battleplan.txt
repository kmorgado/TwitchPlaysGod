PRAISE BE

aka

Twitch Plays God


Twitch channel loads. You see a small island with a central temple and several buildings and a population of people.
You as well as other watchers control the fate of those inhabitants of the island by praying to gods and performing rituals.

Commands:

Praise <Insert God Here>

Show devotion to one of the gods. Each of these gods holds domain over an aspect of the island.

God of Economy
God of Nature/Creation
God of War/Strength

God of Destruction???
Should this be a god or should any destructive elements come from random events?

Vote <Answer>

We will also show poll questions. These are scripted in advance and will likely impact the base game stats.

Stats:

The simulated events on the island will be driven by base stats that are not displayed to the users.

Faith - This stat is a measure of the number of devotions made in proportion to the number of viewers.
Economy - This stat determines how much money is generated per round
Nature/Creation - This stat determines tree production on the island, maybe animals and shit
War/Strength - This stat determines the strength of the population, presumably to prevent attacks from outside?
Anarchy - Randomized
Viewers - How many people are currently viewing
